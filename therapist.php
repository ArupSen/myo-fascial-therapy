<h3>Therapist</h3>
<h4>Astrid Spoon</h4>
<p>Like many people involved in bodywork my career started with an
experience of personal injury and my recovery was greatly aided by good holistic body treatments.</p>
<p>I graduated from the London School of Sports Massage in 2005 and have continued my education ever since. I became a “No Hands Massage” practitioner that same year followed by a Myofascial Release Technique course in 2006.
</p>
<p>In 2007 I came across Trager, a very gentle body-mind approach, which I continued studying for the next 3 years until 2010 when I became a practitioner.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, in 2009, curious to learn more about a softer approach to Myofascialrelease, I did my first course with MFR UK. Their MFR style is strongly influenced by the work of John F.Barnes, an internationally recognized physiotherapist, lecturer, author and leading authority on Myofascial Release. To me this was a natural continuation to the Trager approach and I have since completed all MFR UK courses and in 2011 went twice to the USA to attend seminars with John Barnes himself.</p>
<p>To me, this approach is very exciting and endlessly deep. I continue to go to seminars and receive treatments because I believe that by helping myself I can also be of better assistance to others.</p>
<p>One can always get even better!</p>
