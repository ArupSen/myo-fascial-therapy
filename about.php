<h3>MFR</h3>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Myofascial Release (MFR) is a highly effective treatment approach that focuses on the restrictions in the fascia (connective tissue) of the body.  Fascia is a three-dimensional web, connecting and infusing all other tissues of the body. In its healthy state it is strong, flexible and is housed in a fluid-like ground substance.</p>
<?php img_tag('barnesfascia.jpg','','barnesfascia'); ?>
<?php img_tag('fascia_diagram.jpg','','fascia_diagram'); ?>
<p>Restrictions in this tissue, caused by stress, repetitive strain injuries and/or inflammation create dehydration of the fluid-like ground substance causing extreme tension and compression of the body.</p>

<p>As the fascial tissue restricts there is a loss of fluidity and normal function followed by pain and limited movement. Some symptoms of the restrictions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back Pain</li>
<li>Neck pain</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Carpel Tunnel Syndrome</li>
<li>Pelvic Pain</li>
<li>Scoliosis</li>
<li>Chronic pain and Fatigue</li>
<li>Fibromyalgia</li>
<li>Sports and Work performance problems</li>
<li>Postural Problems</li>
</ul>
<p>MFR releases these restrictions allowing the body to return to its natural state, facilitating postural balance, ease and lightness.</p>
<p>Most people realise that the body stores stress and tension in specific ways such as trigger points, muscle tension and cramps, tension headaches
 
restricted range of movement in the joints etc. Normally this stress and
 
tension will disappear with enough rest, relaxation and exercise but when
 
this does not happen chronic pain patterns develop. Holding patterns of
 
tension for long periods, something that happens often unconsciously,
 
causes the myofascia (muscles and connective tissue) to shorten and
 
harden, putting large amounts of pressure on the nerves, muscles and
 
vascular structures of the body. The result is less ability to cope with life’s
 
stresses and often physical pain. The body adapts to these forces with
 
postural changes and other structural misalignments.</p>
<p>In addition, one may suffer possible emotional traumas, injuries and 
accidents.</p>
<p>Myofascial restrictions do not show up in MRI scans or X-rays and therefore
 
are often missed or misdiagnosed. People may be prescribed drugs or
 
 offered surgery.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Myofascial Release is a gentle hands-on soft tissue release technique
 
whereby the therapist applies sustained pressure onto the restricted tissue
 
area. After a minimum of  90-120 seconds there will be a subtle length change of the
 
tissue and a release can be felt. The therapist follows this release into the
 
next barrier and waits. After a few releases the tissue will feel softer and
 
more flexible. This restoration of the length and quality of the tissue takes
 
pressure off the pain sensitive structures such as nerves and blood vessels,
 
also allowing better alignment and increased mobility in the joints.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>There is a direct link between what you are thinking, what you feel
 
physically and emotionally, and the fascia.
 
Obstructions in thinking can equate to obstructions in the fascia.  

Suppressed emotions,  physical pain or restricted movement can cause bracing and tightening of the fascia.
 
The idea that thinking, emotions and
 
the body are separate is just an idea. 
 
Its not what experience shows.
 
There is much evidence to suggest that emotions and the body are closely connected.
 
If we are injured physically , there is always an thought and emotion
 
connected to it. If any of these 3 aspects is not resolved at the time of injury
 
the body will store it in the fascia. This way our body becomes a container
of unresolved trauma. Long after the injury is healed we can still get
 
symptoms in the same or other areas of the body. Only when the discomfort
 
and pain signal becomes clear enough do people seek help.
 
MFR treats the whole person. One does not have to believe
 
the existence of the connection, just be open to the possibility of change in
 
all aspects of being.</p>

<h3>Remedial and Sports Massage</h3>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
	An individually tailored form of soft tissue massage that can use specific

	techniques to treat stress, tension and fatigue that occurs through

	occupational, recreational or sporting activities.</p>
<p>What are the benefits?</p>
<ul>
<li>Relieves stress and tension that gets in the way of optimal performance.</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of injury during exercise</li>
<li>Speeds up the recovery process and assist in rehabilitation after injury</li>
<li>Increases flexibility and improves the range of motion</li>
<li>Improves postural and general body awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Massage is an ancient form of therapy that has been around for thousands

	of years. It is effective and very safe, and can help to ease pain,

	release tension, inducing relaxation and promoting a feeling of well
	being.

	By working on the soft tissues, Massage stimulates the muscular and nervous systems, and improves the blood circulation and lymphatic flow. This

	enables fresh oxygenated blood to repair the body tissues and metabolic

	waste products and toxins to be eliminated. This in turn allows the body to

	function more efficiently and counteract the debilitating effects of stressful

	modern-day living.</p>
<p>
	Remedial and Sports Massage Therapy is a deeper form of soft tissue

	massage which uses specific techniques to treat physically active

	individuals, who may be more vulnerable to injury because of the stresses

	placed on the body by their sport.</p>
<p>
	The Massage Therapist may also advise on stretching or strengthening

	exercises as appropriate to work in conjunction with treatment. You will

	also be referred appropriately if a different approach would be more

	beneficial.</p>
<p>
	Remedial and Sports Massage is particular effective in treating minor soft

	tissue problems, dealing early on with small aches and pains before they

	develop into more serious overuse injuries. It is also very good in the pre-sporting event situation, either to stimulate or relax and post sporting event to aid relaxation and help recovery.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a sports person to feel the benefits! Muscular tension, stress and fatigue can affect all of us, whether competitive or recreational athletes, dancers musicians, DIY fanatics, gardeners, housewives or stressed executives. Active or sedentary- you will find massage relaxing and therapeutic.</p>
<p>Many people appreciate the deep treatment offered by Remedial and Sports Massage Therapists as they can really feel those knots being “ironed out”. They also become more aware of the warning signs when their bodies tense up under stress and so can take early action to reduce stress levels and relax.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>A brief medical history will be taken prior to the Massage. During the Massage session oil or lotion will be used. This normally is absorbed by the skin fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may feel some post treatment soreness which will normally disappear within a day or two. This is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>You can have a Massage as often as you like as long as you do not suffer any of the conditions for which Massage is contraindicated. Ask the therapist if in doubt. Some people find that a weekly Massage is helpful to manage stress or other problems while others find that a monthly maintenance massage is sufficient.</p>
