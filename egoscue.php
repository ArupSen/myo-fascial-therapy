<h3>The Egoscue Method</h3>
<p>Over the years, I've come to realise that although I was good at releasing the soft tissues in the bodies of my clients, the symptoms (pain) that were relieved would soon come back and persist.</p>
<p>I too have personally struggled with pain from a knee injury that was a result of a subtle yet chronic body imbalance. And after months of not achieving the recovery I'd hoped for using several different modalities, I discovered The Egoscue Method. And upon trialling their exercises for a short period, it had worked!</p>
<p>I believe that people, if they had the opportunity to, would love to feel empowered and possess the knowledge that allows them to help themselves when musculoskeletal issues arise. As well as not having to be dependent on a body therapist alone. Even better, with proper body alignment, chronic pain will disappear and one can have a massage just for pleasure!</p>
<p>The Egoscue Method is a great tool for self care and to me, this method is the perfect active partner to Myofascial Release and Remedial Massage.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>The first appointment will be the longest.</p>
<p>You will have your photos taken; front, back and both sides. (Please wear tight fitted, preferably light coloured clothing or shorts and a top). Plumb lines will be superimposed on the photos and reveal your vertical and horizontal alignment/misalignment.</p>
<p>There is an intake form to fill in and your health history will be taken.</p>
<p>Functional tests will be done to identify dysfunction and compensation.</p>
<p>An analysis will be made, comparing the condition presented with the position of your body</p>
<p>You will then have a personal menu of gentle exercises and stretches created specifically for you, that addresses your personal body issues. You will be asked to trial this menu on a daily basis, for 1 week, before coming back to have it revised, have any of your questions answered, and physically observed to ensure your exercises are being done correctly.</p>
<p>Going through a menu can take anywhere between 15 minutes to 2 hours. We will discuss ways of fitting this into your daily routine. Remember, it is both a financial and time commitment that will aid the improvement of your health. Finally, you will be asked to set goals so that personal progress can be measured.</p>
<p>Apart from helping you to become pain free, the Egoscue Method can also help you to do your favourite activities efficiently better!</p>
