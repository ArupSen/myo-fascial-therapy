<h3>Comments and feedback from clients</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Astrid Spoon is a gifted massage therapist who has trained well in many disciplines. So whether I need a sports, relaxing or a myofascial release massage, I can be assured of a first class treatment. I have been seeing Astrid weekly for over 6 years now &amp; I can honestly say that I have thoroughly enjoyed every single massage, feeling much more relaxed as a result.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I always look forward to my weekly massages and Trager treatments by Astrid Spoon. We have known each other for more than 3 years and Astrid is a highly trained, knowledgeable and dedicated therapist and also very spiritual. After I have had a treatment with Astrid, all my stresses and strains are gone and I feel totally rejuvenated.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Best by a long shot – Whether I need massaging my aches and pains away or I just want my body to have a passive workout, I always feel great after a session with Astrid. Her height enables her to reach parts others can't and she's very strong so can really work those hard to get at places. As extras, she's literate, fun to talk to and always enthusiastic.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Its fantastic to have a treatment and feel entirely secure with Astrid, she is able to give therapy with a good amount of strength but in a controlled way. I run marathons regularly and treatments extend my performance and also accelerate recovery after a run. Astrid takes an informed approach to resolving longer term problems and injuries and she’s helped ease these dramatically.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Astrid's massages are the kind of massage you long for, but never seem to find.   She takes the time to find out where you are physically and considers the best way to deal with the problems whether it be in one session or on going sessions.  In one session it's the perfect massage. In ongoing sessions, Astrid works with a combination of massage, trager and myofascial release.  It's the first time I've understood why you keep going back to the same person.  I have been seeing Astrid for almost 3 years and if I could see her every day I would.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Astrid's deep tissue and myo-fascial massages are fantastic. They have enabled me to carry on training hard , to avoid injury and recover from any niggles,soreness and tightness rapidly. Also aiding in improving my range of movement and flexibility.has She has a gift at finding areas that need attention and the ability to make those areas better. When I have been injured she has speeded my recovery immeasurably . I would highly recommend her services to anybody and everybody.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Astrid works with the body and the mind. She is fantastic at listening to what is wrong and working out what therapy suits me best. My massage varies from week to week, as I gradually get stronger. She has greatly improved the movement in my arm and shoulder after all the lymph nodes were removed and worked on a vein that collapsed after chemotherapy until it has virtually disappeared. I feel that together we are beating breast cancer.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Astrid has fingers of steel wrapped in silk which, together with her knowledge of other techniques, makes her one of the best masseurs I’ve ever known.&rdquo;</blockquote>
